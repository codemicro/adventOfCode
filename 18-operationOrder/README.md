# [Day 18: Operation Order](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/18)

### Part one

Each expression is represented by a list. Each set of brackets in an input is a nested list within that list. For example:

```py
>>> parse_expression("1 + 1 + (3 * 4) + 8".replace(" ", ""))[0]
['1', '+', '1', '+', ['3', '*', '4'], '+', '8']
```

In order to calculate this, a recursive function is used to step through each item and perform any operations found in a linear manner (ie, ignoring [operator precedence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations)).

### Part two

Attempts to use the same data structure for part two, while possible, were difficult and I never actually ended up getting any of them working. I tried two different methods.

* Encasing every single addition operation in a set of brackets (this was done after parsing, so it was actually replacing three items from a list with a list of those three items)
* Selectivley calculating only the additions in an expression before then going on to calculate the multiplication
  * This isn't actually possible - how are you meant to calculate `1 + (2 + 3 * 4)` without multiplication?

After I started wanting to punch myself repeatedly in the head because of the amount of issues I was having with my own solution, I gave up and found an implentation of the shunting-yard algorithm ([this one](http://www.martinbroadhurst.com/shunting-yard-algorithm-in-python.html), to be precise), modified the operator precendences and used that.

It worked first try. *sigh*

At some point, I'd like to come back to this and write my own implementation, and convert the first part to using that new implementation.
