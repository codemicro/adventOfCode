# How to use this template

1. Create a new copy of the `template` directory, and name it as you please. Enter into that directory.
2. Download your challenge input, and save it as `input.txt`.
3. Edit `info.json` to include the challenge title, year and day number as well as any test cases you would like to include.
4. Write your code.
   - If you're using the Go template, ensure you change the import path in `main.go` to `"adventOfCode/<yourDirectory>/go/challenge"`.
5. Run your code.
   - Python: `python ./python`. You may also need to run `pip install -r ../requirements.txt`.
   - Go: `go run ./go`
6. (optional) Delete the copy of this README, rename the other README and edit it.
