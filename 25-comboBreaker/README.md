# [Day 25: Combo Breaker](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/25)

Merry Christmas!

That's Advent of Code done for this year. At the time of writing this, I've not gotten all 49 stars up to this point, so I've got no way to get the 50th star. Even so, I feel slightly cheated out of a part two haha.

I might go back and try some of the other challenges from this year that I didn't complete.
