Solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.

Puzzle inputs and descriptions are not included in this repository. You'll have to get these yourself from the AoC website. [Here's why](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k99rod/sharing_input_data_were_we_requested_not_to/gf2ukkf/?context=3).

## Running solutions

The method of running solutions varies by year.

### All years other than 2020

Solutions to other years' solutions are run via the runner program contained in [`./runtime`](./runtime).

To run a solution, run `go run github.com/codemicro/adventOfCode/runtime` and follow the on-screen prompts. Configurisation options can be seen by running with the `--help` flag.

A benchmark graph can be generated using [`generate-benchmark-graph.py`](./generate-benchmark-graph.py) as follows: `python3 generate-benchmark-graph.py <output file> <year>`.

For example, to generate a graph for the 2021 benchmarks and save it to `challenges/2021/running-times.png`, you can run `python3 generate-benchmark-graph.py challenges/2021/running-times.png 2021`.

### 2020

In 2020, all solutions are in Python and/or Go.

1. `cd` to the challenge directory
   eg: `cd challenges/2020/05-binaryBoarding`
2. Run the desired implementation
   * For Python, run `python3 ./py`
   * For Go, run `go run ./go`

Dependencies for 2020 challenges are not neatly defined anywhere, so determing and installing the correct ones is an exercise for the reader.
